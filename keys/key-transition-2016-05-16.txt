OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for Mihaly Barasz

I have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from
my old key.  The old key has not been compromised and will continue to
be valid for some time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be
encrypted to the new key, and will be making signatures with the new
key going forward.

I would like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.
This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition.  My new
and old keys are signed by each other.  If you have signed my old key,
I would appreciate signatures on my new key as well, provided that
your signing policy permits that without re-authenticating me.

The old key, which I am transitioning away from, is:

pub   rsa2048/553C5D65 2006-03-17 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = 44A5 884E 11E9 99BD EF19  8227 FF10 561E 553C 5D65

The new key, to which I am transitioning, is:

pub   rsa4000/70049997 2016-05-12 [C]
      Key fingerprint = C4D7 B1BC D394 1035 DD5F  08E0 42B2 316F 7004 9997

The entire key may be downloaded from: http://mihaly.barasz.com/keys/70049997.asc

You can also get the key and check that it has been "certified" by my
various online identities on Keybase: https://keybase.io/klao

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 70049997

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 70049997

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the User IDs
match what you expect, I would appreciate it if you would sign my key
and uploaded your signatures to a public keyserver or emailed the
signed key to me.

  gpg --sign-key 70049997
  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-key 70049997

If you'd like any further verification or have any questions about the
transition, please contact me directly!

To verify the integrity of this statement:

  wget -q -O- http://mihaly.barasz.com/keys/key-transition-2016-05-16.txt | gpg --verify
